2.  Language translation for Verify from cloud

3.  In the setup menu, there is now 2 lines Cloud Storage URL.  What are they for?  It think it would be beneficial to have one entry for 1 thing (with a title) and another entry for another thing (with a title).
In the Saving Option, the cloud storage is selected, then, the areas/box, in the cloud storage URL are able to be filled in. If the Cloud Storage is not checked, then,
   i.      the Cloud Storage URL boxes are grayed out

   ii.      In the Main Page, the Cloud box is grayed out.




 

4. ON the main page, if the option is NOT selected (for example, we don’t want to Save to the Cloud) and we mark it inside the Setup menu, is it possible to eliminate the option on the main page?  So, you don’t see that option?  Or for example, you only select the Contactless option to enroll and to verify. Therefore, on the main page you would only see Enrollment and Read Contactless Card. 




5. In the last page, of the enrollment, one of the options to save is to the BIOSID Database.  Can we say, Cloud Database since we don’t know if the user would save it to the BIOSID Cloud database? Or their own? 

Renamed it to Save to Cloud




6. When you select the Cloud Verification, the next page is that you get the enter ID number to enter.  There’s no easy way to get out of that box unless you press the back arrow on the Android tablet menu.  Would it be possible to have a done button at the end of the field so that the user can put the ID number and click that button to move forward?  




7. The same issue happens to the ZIP CODE box (for the address).  If you click enter, it just created a new line.  If you click the Return key, it should allow you to go out of the entry box. 




8. The Cloud verification seems to work. I think that we need to take out the circles in the photo box for the face picture since if I put the 2 yellow circles for my eyes, I’m too close and it doesn’t take a picture or verify the picture properly. 



#### BIOSID_1.0.0.7-debug

   1. Debug version
   2. We need to put the signature as an option.  Right now, it always shows up. So, we need to have in the setup page, if the signature should show up or not to be captured.

   3.  If I decide to eliminate all of the personal information for the user. In the setup page, I unselect the user name fields, addresses, company information, etc… So, there is no data to be entered.  If I save the biometrics to the cloud, I don’t have an ID number then… So, if I try to verify it, I don’t know what my ID number could be! So, we would need to have this ID number somewhere.  Either that it is a required field when we enter the information before we start to enroll a person biometric.  Or we assign a number when we finish storing it to the cloud or BIOSID hard drive.  As soon as it is saved, there’s a message that shows the User ID.
   4. Face capture screen modification
